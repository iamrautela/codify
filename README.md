Codify 🚀

AI-Powered Website Builder

Codify is an AI-driven website builder that allows users to generate, customize, and deploy modern web applications using natural language prompts. Inspired by tools like Bolt and Lovable, Codify converts ideas into production-ready code using the PERN stack.

Codify enables users to describe a website or web app in plain English and instantly receive a fully structured frontend and backend. The platform focuses on speed, scalability, and clean code generation, making it suitable for developers, startups, and non-technical users.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: Prisma

AI Integration: LLM-based prompt-to-code generation

Deployment: Docker / Cloud-ready (AWS, Vercel, etc.)

Core Features
